The tree was not a bad tree, because God doesn't do bad tress (Gen 1:31) Everything in the wolrd was good...But the consequences of this ONE act were substantial (important) or the disobedience.</li><li>The Israel refuses to enter the Promise Land (Canaan) its a human nature to be afraid of gians specially of you have small childrens - but God had told them he would be with them? Who bigger Giants or God?</li><li>Saul saves the best for God (1 Samuel 15:15). God wanted Amalekites dead, down to the last donkey. Saud had a better idea. Bye bye house of Saul..</li><li>God wants the early Christian to worship Him alone, but they sought worship idols, these resulted into widespread apostasy.</li><li>The early adventist was warned of the terrible effects of joining any military stance, that again resulted into another apostasy.</li></ul><p><u>Isaiah 55:8-9 - "For My thoughts are not your thoughts.."</u></p><h3>James 4:1 - "Warring each others"</h3><blockquote>From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</blockquote><p>Trouble's and misunderstanding exist in the church or perhaps inside the family cirle, because the spirit has no supremacy over in our body, but the flesh is.</p><p><u> 1 Peter 2:11 - "abstain from the desires of the flesh..."</u></p><ul><li>If you feed your carnal mind with fleshly lust it will strengthen.</li><li>If you feed your spirit it will strengthen, and if you feed it with spiritual words it will become strong.</li><li>If you think that by going to church once every week and think you gonna have enough to make you spiritual in the rest of the week, but the rest of the week your feeding on daytime talkshows you're gonna be carnal mind will be strenghten.</li><li>What would you think will happened? Which has supremacy Spirit or Carnal? Yet we keep on pleading God for mercy, and turns is mercy into nough.</li><li>Let us always remember that what ever we feed into our minds that we will obey and will have a dominion in our life.</li></ul><h3>1 Cor 2:14 - "Natural man is foolishness"</h3><blockquote>14 But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</blockquote><p>A man that live in a carnal world, doesn't have much appetite on spiritual things.</p><p>Is it familiar when you study the Bible, but you don't get anything at it?</p><p>If a carnal person read the Bible it is not more that reading a history lesson.</p><p>But if the person has the spirit and has the hunger after righteousness, the spirit will guide him and reveal to him that things that a carnal mind cannot see.</p><h3>John 16:23 - "Asked in Jesus Name"</h3><blockquote>23 And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</blockquote><p>As long as we are in this body we will always have a struggle, because of our fleshly desires that battles the spirit</p><p>But the good thing is Christ continue and said...</p><p><u> John 16:33 - "But take courage; I have overcome the world!”</u></p><p><b>Christ has overcame what did he do??</b></p><p>Walking as he walks, he lives amongst us, but he overcame?</p><h4>Common example:</h4><ol><li>Micah 6:8 - "Walk humbly in the company of your God."</li><li>Colossians 1:10-11 - "Do good things & growing in full knowledge of God"</li><li>Deuteronomy 8:6 - "Walk in His ways and by fearing him"</li><li>John 4:32-34 - "I have food to eat that you know nothing about. Do do the will of Him who send me.."</li><li>Luke 10:27 - "Love God with all thy heart, sould, and strength, and mind"</li></ol><p>That is it is very important that before we open the Bible pray that God would give us His spirit to guide us. We should pray with boldness & faith, for any man that ask of God must believe that he is (Hebrews 6:11).</p><p><u>Matthew 5:4 "Bless are they that thirst after Righteousness"</u></p><h3>Romans 7:14 - "Law is Spiritual, I am carnal"</h3><blockquote>14 For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</blockquote><ul><li>You cannot keep the letter of the law alone....nor the spiritual law alone.</li><li>You might not kill someone according to the letter of the law, but you have the same judgement when you start hating your brother?</li><li>You might not commit adultery according to the letter of the law, but you commited the same sin when you look at a woman with lust?</li><li>The letter and the spiritual law are shared.</li><li>Sin is a like a magnet and it is attracted to carnal things the lush of the flesh.</li><li>Paul said that there is nothing good in his body..</li><li>But that doesn't mean that our body is evil or always lead to do evil things...</li><li>Not all carnal things are good like when you desire a food and a water to drink, it only becomes corrupted when you decided to eat or drink that is not good for your health. That's the reason why God give's us brain?</li></ul><p><u>1 Corinthians 10:31 - "Whether therefore ye eat, or drink, or whatsoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</u></p><p>Let us be very extra careful on what we feed our minds lest we stumbled.</p><p>Let us trust in the Lord (Proverbs 3:4-5), believing His promise (John 14:1-3), to always ask for his grace bodly (Hebrews 4:16)</p><br><a href="/encouragement/list" class="btn btn-secondary">Go back</a></div></div></div></article><div class="mastfoot"><!-- Footer--><footer><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center"><li><a href="#"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"></span><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-twitter fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></a></li><li><a href="#"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"></span><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-facebook fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></a></li><li><a href="#"><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"></span><i class="fa fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i><i class="fa fa-github fa-stack-1x fa-inverse"></i></a></li></ul><p class="copyright text-muted">Copyright © Your Website 2017</p></div></div></div></footer></div></body></head>
