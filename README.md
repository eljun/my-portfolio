# Portfolio

The use of this site is to showcase all my capabilities in front-end web development.

# Goals

- Create a portfolio sites using JAMStack approach (completed)
- Host the site in free hosting service eg: heroku, github - use github pages, netlify - jamstack (completed)
- Design the site properly! (in progress)
- Integration of the design (future)

# Vision

**1) Create fully functional semi dynamic sites using static compilers (checked)**

   - Using javascript compilers to easily setup a semi-dynamic environment is considerable fast using a templating engine sush as jade (pug).
   - By using compilers such as HARP.JS static sites has never been this easier.
   
**2) Create a very cheap sites, almost cost & hassle free (checked)**
   - You don't pay for hosting.
   - You only have to pay for domain hosting, nothing more.
   
**3) Create an indistructable site, almost free from DOS & Malware attacks. (checked)**
   - Since the site is hosted from github it most likely be affected by malwares & DoS, cool isn't it?
   - However your site repository will be available publicly, unless you pay for a private repo.
   
**4) Create a site that is free from painful setup & configurations**
   - You avoid server environment setup for your basic to rich media sites.
   - One install using NODE JS and you're ready to deploy your site seemlessly.
   - Backup not a problem when using github, you just have to create multiple `branch`.

# What's the fuss

- This site is fully running under $20 for 2 years of domain hosting only nothing more nothing less.
- Site is still in progress so pardon for poorly design site.
